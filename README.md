## Perlin Noise Fun

By Atul Varma, June 9 2013

This is just some experimentation I did with Perlin noise.

I learned the basics of the algorithm from a [Perlin noise page][1] on
the internet, but derived a number of formulas on my own to ensure that
I grasped the concepts. However, this means my implementation could be
incorrect or inefficient.
